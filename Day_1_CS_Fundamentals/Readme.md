# Computer Programming Fundamental
### Agenda
- How the CPU/Processor works in the Computer ?
- How the C program executes ?

#### Here I am trying to summarize the concepts by asking questions

### 1. What is processor/CPU ?
  - Processor is a semiconducting device which is responsible for provides the instructions and processing power to the computer to work.

### 2. What is the Semiconducting Device ?
  - A semiconductind device which is the one contians dioads and transistors.
  - Dioads and transistors (PNP & NPN) which take only 2 inputs
      - Low voltage : 0v
      - High voltage : 5v 
  - In computer terminalogy it will be represented as a binary format 
      - Low voltage : 0 
      - High voltage : 1 
  - So the processor in computer only understand 0's and 1's, Finally this is the main reason behind Computers only understand binary code (0's and 1's) this is called  " machine level language (MLL) ".
